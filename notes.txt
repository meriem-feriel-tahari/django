every time we add and app in django we need to add it in setings file 
to create and app we need to write python startapp and then the name of the app 
when we send a request to an url the view function will be called
#for urls first the app go to storefront and do (path(
    "playground",include(playground.urls)
))
this means if it has playground/smth it will automaticlly use the urls file from playground.url in which we have if we have playground/hello we will call 
path("hello",views.hello)//here we are calling the function hello in views when we call playground/hello
before starting in any project we need to build the schema of the database 
and we kinda call it data modelling
here we can represent relationships between data like one to one one to many and many to many
